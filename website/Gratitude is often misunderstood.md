gratitude is not simply saying thank you, it's simply having trust. Grateful living, because you receive every moment as a gift. 

"What's the opportunity in this moment?"" Ask that, look for it, and then take advantage of it 

Reminds me a lot of what gratitude is talked about in Lily Singh's book "How to be a Triangle"
