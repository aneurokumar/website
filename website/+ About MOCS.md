MOCs, or Maps of Content, is a way to group a large amount of ideas related to one another. Instead of folders, MOCs allow different ideas across domains to collide in one place. For example, notes about Hardwater into dishwasher and milliq machine ruining machines can be linked to my Lab Management MOC and my Biological Science MOC.
