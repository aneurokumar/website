Black box thinking is heavy in programming, and refers to concepts where we don't know its innerworkings, just that it works and has a purpose.

This is useful when you need to figure out how different parts of a larger system need to work together. It allows you to breaking down parts of a large process into smaller pieces, so you can look at the larger picture and how they relate to one another.

For programming, it allows you to *not* think about it as "what does the code do" - instead it's about the structure before and after the code passes. 

Some questions to help with this:
* how will you test and update the code?
* is it easy to scale?
* how does it affect other downstream activities?
* what are some problems that could arise?
