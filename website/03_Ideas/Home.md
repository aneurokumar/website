## Hi, I'm Anu
I'm a biotech professional based in Paris, passionate about biology, stress-free workflows, compassionate self-improvement, and bubble tea. Welcome to my [[./Second Brain|second brain]].

A little about me:
📍: [[./the Paris note|Paris, France]]
💼: Lab Ops Associate at Biolabs Hôtel-Dieu, Paris, France
🎓: [[./Bachelors in Neuroscience from University of Tennessee, Knoxville|Bachelors in Neuroscience]], currently studying [[./Cértificate de Compétence en Bio-informatique|Bioinformatics]]
💪: Molecular biology, data analysis, mammalian cell culture, and [[../01_Maps/Lab Management MOC|lab management]]
💗: Dogs, bubble tea, smooth ball-point pens, and a good book!

## How to use this site
This contains my second brain (or digital garden/online commonplace book) for [learning in public](https://grow-self.com/learning-in-public/#:~:text=Learning%20in%20public%20is%20a%20growing%20trend%20and,you%E2%80%99re%20learning%20and%20making%20it%20accessible%20to%20others.). Some of these notes are cohesive thoughts, while others are the beginnings of an idea. Eventually it'll house my portfolio. This site is a perpetual work in progress!

The Navigation on the left and the Node Graph on the right are always available. But if you want a more concrete place to start, check out any of these pages.
