There are four types of potential SOP updates:

1. **Update.** For example, screenshots that need to be changed.
2. **Simplification.** For example, some descriptions are too wordy and can be simplified.
3. **Elimination.** This is where certain steps are no longer necessary due to an app or process improvement.
4. **Automation.** This is where something was being done manually but is now automated because of a script or app update.

Some suggestions

* **simple SOP updates** can be updated by the team directly and then send out a notification to the team
* **complex SOP updates** involve substantially changing the process OR eliminating it completely
