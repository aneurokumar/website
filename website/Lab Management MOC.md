> [!info]
> This MOC focuses on Lab Management and closely associated topics such as leadership, equipment, technology, protocols, and safety.

Lab Management is a huge part of my identity and career, and is a unique blend of research/engineering, operations, stakeholder management, writing, presenting, IT, and science. It involves a lot of technical knowledge of machines, chemicals, and different assays.
