> [!Info] About
> I completed a 4-year post secondary degree in the USA known as a "Bachelors," and received it in Neuroscience with a minor in Psychology. The degree was interdisciplinary, allowing me to choose a path that would prepare me for jobs in molecular/cellular neuroscience with a deep understanding of behaviors and their neural mechanisms.
> 
> I also did a lot of cool stuff, like hosting science podcasts, wrote for the newspaper, and was in marching band.
