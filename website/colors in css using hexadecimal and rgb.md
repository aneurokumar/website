> **Summary**
> Colors can be configured in three different ways: hexadecimal, rgb, and hsl.

### hexadecimal
hexadecimal is used to precise colors in html/css languages

Regular decimal system is 0-9, but hexadecimal goes from 0-15, using a b c d e & f to represent the remaining numbers

the 6 slots are grouped into groups of 2, the first group represents R, the second G, the third B
RR GG BB on a scale of 0 - ff, the smaller the number the less of that color we have

### rgb and rgba
goes from 0-255 for each color

a refers to transparency. 1 is opaque and 0 is transparent, everything in between is partial transparency

### hsl and hsla
h = the color
s = how powerful this color will be
l = how bright the color will be
a = transparency
