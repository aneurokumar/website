Internet of Things (iot) is a system that allows machines to connect and share data with other machines through special modules or add-ons, whereas previously they couldn't!

A great example in context in Elemental Machines, who develop interfaces with many different incubators so that it communicates data about CO2, temperature, door openings, etc. to their dashboard and we can see it in a graphic interface.

> In an enterprise context, IoT devices are used to monitor a wide range of parameters such as temperature, humidity, air quality, energy consumption, and machine performance. This data can be analyzed in real time to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that can help businesses optimize their operations and improve their bottom line.

# Different parts of IoT
These are the different science/tech domains that converge for IoT to exist!
* **sensors/actuators:** sensors convert physical characteristics into electrical impulses, and actuators take this information to perform downstream actions
* **connection tech:** wifi, bluetooth, cellular, etc.
* **computing:** infrastructure to store/analyze data and host/deploy the IoT applications
* **data science:** ML, ML models, data visualization, predictive analytics
* **cybersecurity:** encryption, access/intrusion, data protection and privacy

# IoT gateway
a gateway is like a router (like your wifi box) and allows the IoT devices and the cloud to speak to each other. It handles two-way communication traffic.
