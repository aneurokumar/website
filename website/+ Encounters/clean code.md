# Naming Variables
* **Meaningful names**: avoid comments to explain what the variable is.
	* instead of` var d; // elapsed time in days`, use `var elapsedTimeInDays`
* **Disinformation/Misnomers**: some common spoken words mean something specific in coding, like "list"
	* instead of `var accountList = [ ]`, you can just use `accounts = [ ]`

# Functions
* **Keep them small and doing one thing:** "They should really be 20 lines long. The longer a function gets, it is more likely...to do multiple things and have side effects."

# Other
* **Know the language style guides:** Just like each newspaper has a style guide, so does each coding language.
	* quick example: snake_case in python, and camelCase in Java
