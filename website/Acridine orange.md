> [!TLDR] TLDR
> A fluroescent dye that binds with DNA or RNA, used in fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry.


Staining procedure for flow cytrometry includes [different buffer preparations](https://microbeonline.com/acridine-orange-staining-principle-procedure-results-applications/#Staining_procedure), and it's [used](https://microbeonline.com/acridine-orange-staining-principle-procedure-results-applications/#Applications) mostly to confirm presence of bacteria in positive blood cultures as a "double check" if there's still doubt after gram staining.

Some other applications include:
- For enumerating the microbial load in a sample since acridine orange binds with the nucleic acid of both living and dead bacteria.
- Detection of cell wall-deficient bacteria (e.g., mycoplasmas) grown in cultures. Cell wall deficient bacteria are hard to visualize in Gram stain as they cannot retain Gram stain dyes.
- For differential staining of human cells and prokaryotic cell with a fluorescence microscope. Human cells are stained black to faint green in which bright orange organisms are easily detected.
- Acridine orange is also used in a method referred to as theÂ [quantitative buffy coat (QBC)](https://microbeonline.com/quantitative-buffy-coat-qbc-test-principle-method-analysis/), a rapid screening tool for the detection of malaria.
- For analyzing mitochondria and lysosomal content by flow cytometry.
- For visual detection of nucleic acids on agarose and polyacrylamide gels.
- For identifying engulfed apoptotic cells because they will fluoresce upon engulfment.
