### Intro
I noticed I was losing a lot of valuable knowledge.

Advancing through my career and projects, I had thousands of notes in research notebooks, journals, and word documents detailing processes, terminology, and valuable experiences. But with every new challenge, I lost time and motivation by reinventing wheels I _had already created,_ like:
* re-writing SOPs from scratch
* forgetting concepts from valuable books
* misplacing sources and quotes for articles

#### What's a second brain?
>"...**an external, centralized, digital repository for the things you learn** and the resources from which they come...(leaving) **our biological brain to imagine, create, and simply be present**."
> - Tiago Forte

In Spring 2023, I read [Building a Second Brain](https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/), then watched Nick Milo’s video on Linking Your Thinking. Since then, I’ve been filling my Second Brain with notes and creating insights that I share with others. In November 2024, I started publishing a public version of my second brain using Quartz and GithubPublic.

Some of these notes are fleshed out and well developed, others short works-in-progress. Don't be afraid to poke around!

Don't know where to start? Look through my [[Book Notes|Book Notes]].
