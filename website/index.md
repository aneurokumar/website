## How to use this site
This contains my professional history portfolio and doubles as my second brain (or digital garden/online commonplace book) for [learning in public](https://grow-self.com/learning-in-public/#:~:text=Learning%20in%20public%20is%20a%20growing%20trend%20and,you%E2%80%99re%20learning%20and%20making%20it%20accessible%20to%20others.).

Some of these notes are cohesive thoughts, while others are the beginnings of an idea.

The Navigation on the left-hand side is always available on the screen, however it's much more fun if you poke around the available pages.
