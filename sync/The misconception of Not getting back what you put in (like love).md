you assume that the love you give someone will come back from there in the same form.

Love is like a circle because it always comes back (much like other energies you put out) but the issue is with your expectations 

The love we give out comes back to us from a variety of sources

Ask yourself: "Am I offering help as much as I'm asking for help?"
