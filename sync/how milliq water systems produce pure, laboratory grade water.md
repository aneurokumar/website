> [!summary] Summary  
> Milli-Q water is a water purification system for labs which include high-flow and ultrapure water systems. It removes contaminants/impurities and distributes water free from particles, ions, and other organic compounds.  
>   
> Side note: do not drink this, or use the Ultrapure water for equipments!  
  
# Purity via reverse osmosis, de-ionization, and UV irradiation  
MilliQ water is purified to Type I standard = very low impurities. It goes through a multi-step process (see heading).  
  
Type 1 = Ultrapure Water for highly sensitive applications  
Type 2 = General laboratory use

**Reverse osmosis (RO)**  
Separation of water molecules from other substances using a semi-permeable membrane. This even works for dissolved/suspended compounds (like chemicals or other bio substances like bacteria). The membrane is too small for the other compounds to move through, but water can pass through it easily.  
  
> Osmosis is the diffusion of water down the concentration gradients/membranes, so reverse osmosis is just separating the water from other ions.

**Deionization**  
This is the process to remove all dissolved salts. For deionization to work, the water must go through two [[./ion channels|ion exchange]] components.  
  
*Step 1: Releasing H+ (hydrogen) ions*  
How it works is the metallic ions in water stick themselves to the "exchange material," and then the exchange material releases hydrogen ions in proportion. This allows the overall electrical charges to be balanced. The water is partially treated at this point because the positive metallic ions are removed. Now it has a bunch of H+ ions and is acidic. So it goes to step 2.  
  
> **Examples**: A sodium ion (Na+) displaces one hydrogen ion (H+); Calcium ion (Ca+) displaces 2, Ferric ion (Fe+++) displaces 2, etc.  
  
*Step 2: releasing OH- (hydroxyl) ions*  
The water treated in step 1 goes to another unit with anion exchange material. This exchange material usually has replaceable hydroxyl anions and fixed irreplaceable cations.  
  
Now the negative ions (anions) are absorbed into the anion exchange material, and OH- ions are released in its placed.  
  
What flows out of this now is ion-free water. The H+ ions and the OH- ions form together to make water (H2O) that's not different from the way they were produced (besides now being contaminant and ion free, whereas the water at the beginning was neither!)

**UV Irradiation**  
The water from step 2 is pumped through a tube or new chamber, past a UV light. The UV light kills UV-sensitive microorganisms (like Viruses and bacteria), and exits through the dispenser, purified.
