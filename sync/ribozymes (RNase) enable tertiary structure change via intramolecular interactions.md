Ribozymes are RNA molecules that can catalyze specific biochemical reactions, like RNA splicing and gene expression, similar to the typical protein enzyme. The most common thing they do is cleave.  
  
**example of ribonuclease P**  
ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a holoenzyme (complete, functional enzyme that's catalytically active) that requires a coenzyme to become active. RNase P targets the 5' ends of precursor tRNAs and cleaves them to produce mature tRNAs.
