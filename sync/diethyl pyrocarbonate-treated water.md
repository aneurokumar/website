DEPC is used to inactivate RNase enzymes in water and on lab equipment, by modifying histidine, lysine, cysteine, and tyrosine residues. DEPC-treated water reduces the risk of RNA degradation via RNases.  
  
**buffer compatibility**  
* DEPC is unstable in water and shouldn't be used in Tris or HEPES buffers  
* can be used with PBS or MOPS  
> rule: enzymes/chemicals with active -O: -N: or -S: can't be treated with DEPC because DEPC will react with these groups  
  
**How to make DEPC treated water**  
* water is treated with 0.1% DEPC for 2 hours at room temperature-37ÂºC, then autoclaved to inactivate DEPC  
* DEPC inactivation via autoclaving yields CO2 and ethanol
