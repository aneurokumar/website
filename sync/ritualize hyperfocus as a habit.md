It's important to ritualize hyperfocus. The best sessions are when the session is challenging and meets your abilities.

You can enter a hyperfocus state by setting intentions, and choosing a complex task. If the task is not challenging enough, we will feel bored. If it's too challenging, we might feel anxious.

To increase quality of hyperfocus sessions, work on increasing your Working Memory Capacity = this is how many pieces of information you can hold in your head at the same time. Meditation helps with this.
