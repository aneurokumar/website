You can still be happy at a job you're not "passionate" about!

You need three things
* Usefulness: Feeling like your work makes a difference 
* Comradery: Enjoy the people you work with
* Mastery: Be good at what you do

The stress on "finding your passion" is overrated and not for everyone. Passion cultivated, not innate
