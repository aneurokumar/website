# Primers
Primers, aka oligonucleotides (oligos), are key in DNA synthesis. They're small pieces of single-stranded nucleotides, around 5-22 bps in length. Primers must be complementary to DNA strands, which "prime" the strands to allow DNA polymerase to bind and start DNA synthesis

There are DNA and RNA primers, and DNA primers are used in experiments because they're mot stable. RNA primers are more common in vivo, but DNA primers are used in PCR amplification, DNA sequencing, cloning, etc.

**DNA primers** vs ***RNA primers***
* Reaction:
	* **amplification is temp. dependent, requires less proteins**
	* ***replication is enzyme dependent catalytic reaction, requires lots of proteins*
* Length:
	* **18-24 bps**
	* ***10-20 bps*
* Creation:
	* **chemically syntheized (lab made)**
	* ***primase (type of RNA polymerase) creates them*
* Viability:
	* **longer shelf-life, more stable**
	* ***shorter life, more reactive*

# Experimental Methods
* ELISAs
* pbmcs are a source of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers
* Meso Scale Discovery: similar to ELISA, but higher sensitivity, larger detection range, and still efficient at low volume samples. Also has minimized matrix effect, which helps with simultaneous multiplex detection with high precision.
