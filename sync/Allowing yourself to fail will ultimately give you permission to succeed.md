I feel this in every part of my life. If you dont allow yourself to fall and get back up, you will never learn. A huge skill is bein able to reconize real threats fom unreal, anxious threats. That's why I hate the whole "get it right the first time and everytime" because it was such bs.

Don't do it unless it's perfect should also be taken with a grain of salt
