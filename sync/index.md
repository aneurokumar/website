## How to use this site  
This contains my second brain (or digital garden/online commonplace book) for [learning in public](https://grow-self.com/learning-in-public/#:~:text=Learning%20in%20public%20is%20a%20growing%20trend%20and,you%E2%80%99re%20learning%20and%20making%20it%20accessible%20to%20others.). Some of these notes are cohesive thoughts, while others are the beginnings of an idea. Eventually it'll house my portfolio. This site is a perpetual work in progress!  
  
The Navigation on the left and the Node Graph on the right are always available. But if you want a more concrete place to start, check out these featured notes below!
