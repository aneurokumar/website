**Homebrew** is a [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software "Free software") and [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software "Open-source software") software [package management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager "Package manager") that simplifies the installation of software on [Apple's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc.") operating system, [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS "MacOS"), as well as [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux"). The name is intended to suggest the idea of building software on the Mac depending on the user's taste.

It's the easiest way to access open-source packages for Mac, essential for things like community projects or even using open-source tools for your own private projects! Compatible with things hosted on GitHub
* if you want to install a library, that library might have *other libraries* that you need to install in order to work
* you'll also need to make sure each contingent library is up to date with ever new release!
Homebrew is a one-stop shop to keep them up to date.

It's still a way to install "normal" apps too, like Zoom or Skype. You don't *need* to go to the tool's website and go through the download-install-cleanup cycle.

By default, it is installed into `/usr/local` on [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel "Intel")-based machines and `/opt/homebrew` on [Apple silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon "Apple silicon"). The installation consists of a [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git "Git") repository that enables users to update Homebrew by pulling an updated repository from [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub "GitHub").

you can install packages using `brew install pkgname`, where pkgname is the package name
