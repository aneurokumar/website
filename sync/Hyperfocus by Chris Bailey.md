# ðŸ“šHyperfocus by Chris Bailey

Foundational concepts
* Define productivity by completing the things you intend to do, rather than trying to do a lot of work for work's sake. Stating intentions before work is important for productivity.
* Hyperfocus and Scatterfocus are two sides of the same coin. Hyperfocus is intense focus with intention (and attention) on one problem/task. Scatterfocus is deliberate "mind-wandering" to cultivate creativity and insights.

**Attentional Space**
* Attention is finite: there's a limit to how many things we can pay attention to and think about - this is your [[./attentional space is limited and prone to attentional residue|attentional space]]. Certain tasks will require more attentional space than others. 
* Attentional Residue: "Switching gears" doesn't happen seamlessly. Some attention is still left on the previous task after we've switched to the new one, using precious attention space.

**Habits vs Complex Tasks in the brain**
* [[./habits are managed by the basal ganglia and take less attentional space|Habits take a lot less attentional space to execute]]. Habit-based tasks are managed more by the basil ganglia (motor/movement habits, while the PFC manages more cognition-heavy tasks
* Multitasking can work under very specific conditions. You can't exceed the capacity of the attentional space.
* Combinations of tasks that fit into the attentional space:
	* few, small habit-based tasks
	* one complex task and one habit-based task
	* one complex task
* Avoid filling your attentional space completely!
**Intentions are the bouncer of your attention**
* Intention protects attention by keeping distractions out and gives you a goal to come back to during the session
* Getting distracted is human - bring your attention back when you notice it drifting
* Being aware of what we're thinking about can improve our problem-solving. Observing our thoughts (without judgement - mindfulness) can temporarily expand our attentional space.
	* [[./Meditation can expand our attentional space|Meditation can expand our attentional space]]
Self-Experiments
* Keep a journal and write down all the things that have distracted you during the day. [Interstitial journaling](https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling) method.

## Ch. 3: The Power of Hyperfocus

> [!Summary] Stages of Hyperfocus, Strong Intentions, Awareness Cues
> Contents

* Hyperfocus precedes the Flow State, Intention comes before Attention! Odds of achieving flow state go up when there are less things competing for our attention.
* Hyperfocusing is keeping one important, complex task in your awareness while you work.
* Implementation intentions 
* 3 ways to strengthen intention setting
	* Rule of 3: Choose 3 things you want to accomplish by EOD
	* Most Consequential: Choose most consequential tasks that will have positive ripple effects when it's finished.
	* Hourly Chime: Set an alarm/chime to go off every hour, prompting you to reflect on what you're focusing on.
