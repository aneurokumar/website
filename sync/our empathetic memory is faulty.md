we can empathize with people better if we've gone through the same or similar situation  
  
however it's hard for us to keep the full context of our previous experiences at the forefront of our minds when another person is currently going through that experience  
  
we might have a tendency to judge harshly, opting for logical and sterile reasoning rather than remembering how rough it was to be in the middle of it ourselves  
  
once the situation got better for us, our empathetic memory almost becomes "faulty" until we hit another low (same situation or not)
