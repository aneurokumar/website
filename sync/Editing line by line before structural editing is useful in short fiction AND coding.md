# ***Editing line by line before structural editing is useful in short fiction AND coding***  
I always held the belief that editing from a top-down approach was the best: look at the ideas, the paragraphs, the sentences order, then the word choice and grammar. Reading the SFF Craft book, the suggestion to go line-by-line editing THEN structurally editing was something new.  
  
For coding this is how I’d approach it (at this stage at least). You need to understand what kinds of sentences you’re making in order to realize if they are appropriately used in that scene or not. If you’re calling a function, then you’d have to use the correct syntax to get the item that you want. Once you know how that works, then you can decipher if that line of code is needed for what you want to accomplish.
