X::  Think Like A Monk by Jay Shetty 

I think it was a famous sprinter (usain bolt??) that was looking like he was casually strolling through the park when he won the sprinting event and that's because he did practice like he wanted to perform. He practiced past the point of performance

If you need to reach a goal for performance (like speaking in French or giving a presentation) you need to practice past the skill level you need so that the desired skill level is closer to your baseline and it's actually easier to achieve during performance

You can't rely on yourself to be at 100% all the time. But you can probably rely on yourself being at 80% for a majority of the time. 

Get your skill to the point where you only have to exert 80% energy to perform the desired skill and you'll perform better yourself and in comparison to the competition, and you won't be easily worn out. It's easier to hit that goal consistently. It'll also help with stress management. 

When you perform you don't want to reach new heights. You want to hit the height exactly how you envisioned. No and libbing for the most part (except maybe in jazz improv?) and if yes, you'll stay in the structure you give yourself to perform at 80% energy required vs actually achieving your results at 100% energy expenditure
