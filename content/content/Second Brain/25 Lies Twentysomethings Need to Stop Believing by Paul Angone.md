## Highlights

Or maybe the lie starts becoming a part of us, like a skin graft where we can no longer separate our own skin from the imposter. — location: [226]() ^ref-64836

## Chapter Highlights

Success happens to a lot of people, but they have no capacity, strength, or foundation to build from it. — location: [355]() ^ref-50891

This is actually something I'm very aware and afraid of.


If you’re truly humble, nothing will touch you, neither praise nor disgrace, because you know what you are. — location: [409]() ^ref-40998


To help you build that habit, find more truth-tellers in your life as well. We all need wise counselors, mentors, authors, and advisors in our lives. — location: [422]() ^ref-55111


We crave being seen. To justify our existence. To validate our worth. Especially during those seasons when we feel most unsure or insecure. — location: [447]() ^ref-41391


And the sheer amount of people seeing you usually has a direct correlation with the lack of people who truly know you. — location: [449]() ^ref-51631


“Hopelessness and helplessness are horrible things to live with and they erode morale and coping ability.” — location: [462]() ^ref-49958


We lose hope much too quickly. We become sure of our defeat when we haven’t even started the race. — location: [540]() ^ref-8743


You have so much waiting for you. Even if you can’t see it right now, it’s there, waiting with a knowing smirk. I promise. You can believe in hope. You can cling to it when the ship feels like it’s going down. We must. — location: [541]() ^ref-30379


There are so many times in our twenties, and in the many years thereafter, where it can feel like we will never escape the current situation we are in. I’m here to tell you, we will. Things will change. They always do. — location: [602]() ^ref-27653


Hope lived as fact and hard work are a powerful combo. — location: [610]() ^ref-22885


Do you treat hope more as a feeling or a fact? Does hope seem naïve or is hope a necessity? — location: [611]() ^ref-43611

I treat it personally as more of a feeling, and have a hard time thinming about it as a fact. Instead ik thibk that it's afact that hope gives us life and energy, and when that's taken away our ability to cope and achieve is small. Honestly, it's one of the reasons why I am wanting to strengthen my spirituality this year.


War for hope. — location: [621]() ^ref-54959


You see, what you’re doing right now, regardless of the situation, it matters. — location: [643]() ^ref-36175


Indifference is a choice. — location: [645]() ^ref-2849


When you’re lost in the woods, each step actually matters much more than when you know exactly where you’re going. — location: [647]() ^ref-55467


When you find yourself lost in the dark, that’s the time to slow down the most. To really focus on your other senses, you have to force yourself to think clearly and critically. It’s when you panic and try to frantically escape that you end up becoming more lost or hurting yourself and others. — location: [656]() ^ref-26010

We pass responsibility down the line to the next person, never realizing that we’re standing in a circle, playing a game of indifference like it’s duck-duck-goose. — location: [681]() ^ref-56884


When I die, I don’t want people talking about what I critiqued; I want them talking about what I created. — location: [689]() ^ref-60024

I keep seeing lots of words pointing to create.
