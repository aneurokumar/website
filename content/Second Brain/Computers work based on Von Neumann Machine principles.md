## How a computer works
* comps allow the manipulation of information, with primary functions being to store, treat, and move information/data, and control the function of the computer itself
* Computers are created based on the Principles of the Von Neumann Machine 1946

## Von Neumann Machine
The basis for modern computing

> [!IMPORTANT] Von Neumann Machine
> "A theoretical design for a sotred program computer that...consists of a central processor with an arithmetic/logic unit and a control unit, a memory, mass storage, and input and output." ([source](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32480/von-neumann-architecture#:~:text=A%20von%20Neumann%20architecture%20machine%2C%20designed%20by%20physicist,as%20the%20basis%20for%20almost%20all%20modern%20computers.))

Consists of the following 4 parts
* **[[./Central processing unit (CPU)|Central Processor]]:** containing a command unit (UC) AND a logical/arithmetic unit (UAL/ALU)
* A memory unit
* **Mass storage**: Memory that can contain programs and data
* **Input and output:** An entry and exit unit (E/S or I/O) that allows the user to put data into the memory, AND read it back out when the machine has manipulated it
	* this unit also allows data exchange with peripherals

a program is a set of logical operations that can be performed on data/information
