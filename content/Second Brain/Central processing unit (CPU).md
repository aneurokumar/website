* Intel introduced the first CPU in 1971 on an integrated chip  
* multicore processes were commonplace by the mid-2000s  
  
# How a CPU works  
1. CPU gets instructions from the computer's memory, decodes it, and learns what it needs to do next  
2. actually executes the task it figured out from step 1  
3. after task is done, it stores the result in a register or the memory (depending on the program)  
  
# CPU components  
Technically there are 3 components: the arithmetic logic unit, a control unit, and registers  
1. **Arithmetic logic unit (ALU):** does math (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and logic (comparisons) operations on data  
2. **Control unit (UC):** gets instructions from memory, decodes it, then speaks to ALU and other computer parts to execute the task(s)  
3. **Registers:** small storage areas inside the CPU, can hold data/instructions currently being processed
