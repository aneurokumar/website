A transmembrane protein in all animal cells, and important in action potentials in neurons. Also known as a Na+/K+ pump, or sodium-potassium ATPase.

The sodium-potassium pump uses ATP to export 3 sodium ions out of the cell and and import 2 potassium ions, resulting in a loss of 1 positive ion per pump. 

The pumps help cells stay at resting potential, which is important for homeostasis and signal pathways.
