Resistance doesn't look the same for everyone. It's commonly expressed in one of two ways: active or passive.
* **active:** finding fault, appealing to fear, meeting with leaders to prevent the change
* **passive:** withholding information, weaponized incompetence/feigning ignorance

Ignoring user resistance is NEVER the solution!! If you ignore it, you risk facing long term consequences anywhere from reduced quality/productivity to hostile working environment. *People don't trust leaders who can't prepare an organization for change.*

Here are some examples of the consequences if you ignore user resistance.

There are ways to shorten and lessen the impact of this reaction - most of it boils down to these points:
* open and consistent communication
* encouraging healthy debate and addressing concerns
* before a change, tell people the rational behind the decision (back up with numbers when possible!)
* take on Agile mindset for implementing changes, monitoring progress, and incorporating feedback
