# ***vampire symbolism can go deeper than paranormal romance***  
  
In "How to Read Books like a Professor," there's an interesting chapter about vampirism. It was popularized by Brahm Stoker's "Dracula" of course, but saw a resurgence in the end of the 20th century and skyrocketed with Stephanie Meyer's "Twilight." Before the 20th century, vampires were portrayed as older men who would kidnap young women and bite/drain them of blood to extend their own life force, sometimes turning them into vampires in the process or just killing them.  
  
The analysis Foster gives was insightful. Vampires are a metaphor for exploitation, sin, and misogyny in many cases. An older man, preying on younger (and in medieval times, this usually meant "virginal") women, and taking away her humanity/innocence. There's a loss of agency and autonomy for the victim, who ends up dying or just as corrupt as the perpetrator.  
  
Paranormal teen fiction seemed to get off the ground because there's a spin on it. Many vampire love interests don't take agency away from the human women/girls they desire. The story is usually told from the viewpoint of the non-vampire protagonist. Having power in a normally powerless situation is, understandably, palatable for readers.
