this is reliable marker of how emotionally healthy, happy, and physically well people will be as they age

isolation is a slow killer, and warps the way we see people and thus our ability to have meaningful in-person relationships. forces us into a "defensive crouch"

we see people as more and more critical, unwelcoming, etc. which leads us further into a bitter mindset, which leads to more isolation. it's a negative feedback loop.
