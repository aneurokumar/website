MOCs, or Maps of Content, is a way to group a large amount of ideas related to one another. They're like "topics," except much less restrictive, and the same idea can be linked to different MOCs. MOCs provide context for linking ideas across domains to collide in one place. 

For example, notes about Hardwater into dishwasher and milliq machine ruining machines can be linked to my [[./Lab Management MOC|Lab Management MOC]] and my [[./Biological Science MOC|Biological Science MOC]].
