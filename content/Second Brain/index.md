“Don’t let anyone rob you of your imagination, your creativity, or your curiosity." - [Mae Jemison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mae_Jemison)

A [[./second-brain|second brain]] is a repository of knowledge, usually digital, and highly personal.

My second brain hosts my [[./Articles|articles]] and [[./"Book Notes"|notes I take from books]], but also my notes and projects from my Bioinformatics class, equipmnt technical specs, and even some stuff on cooking, culture, and random concepts.

Some notes are highly polished, others are not! Don't know where to start? Check out my Book Notes folder in the Explorer, and start clicking around!
