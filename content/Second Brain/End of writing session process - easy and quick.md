**Related**: Writing MOC, [[./Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte|Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte]], there's not one correct process for writing, or even a specific kind of style for each author. It's more important to have a variety of tools in your toolbox

> **Summary**  
> After a fruitful writing session, use a simple end of writing session process to help set up the next session for success.  
  
At the end of the session:  
* **Write down ideas for next steps:** this can be ideas/topics to explore or research/workshopping you need to do for the next session  
* **Write down current status:** what section did you finish? is part of it polished, part of it very rough draft? are the characters/plot/points not developed? are there certain things you *don't* need to worry about?  
* **Write down details that youâ€™re likely to forget after you step away:** details about world building, certain points to avoid, remember that certain characters are in a different country in this place, potential plot holes, etc.  
* **Write down intention for next work session:** how many words do you want to write? do you want to flesh out a specific character? do you want to conduct research?
