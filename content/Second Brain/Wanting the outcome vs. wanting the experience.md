Pay attention to things you wish you could *do* vs things you wish you *had*. 

Wanting the outcome vs. wanting the experience *that comes with the outcome* are two different things and can be conflicting ideals.

What are some things you could learn from having spent so much time meditating, being able to recite scripture, of getting a PhD instead of just being handed one?

We often will need outcomes to improve our situation, and [[./Enjoy the journey not just the destination|choosing adventures based on if we enjoy the journey]] is a priviledged mindset.

However, this puts into context that some of our "wants" aren't actually wants at all. They're a symptom of something different.

"Do you wish you could do that, or do you wish you could learn to do that?" The monk said to Shetty while in the ashram, after pointing to different monks who could meditate for hours or recite long pages of scripture.
