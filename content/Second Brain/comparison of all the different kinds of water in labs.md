Water purity comparison ([source](https://www.yasa.ltd/post/ultrapure-deionized-ro-distilled-and-double-distilled-waters-what-is-the-difference))
![[../what kind of water to use for equipments-1.png|what kind of water to use for equipments-1.png]]

MilliQ water (de-ionized water) will leach metal ions from equipment, and will cause the metal to corrode much quicker.

For things like waterbaths and incubators, use autoclaved tap water or autoclaved Type 2 water. 

On [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/qosvnl/what_type_of_water_should_i_use_in_water_bath/) someone mentioned having used 50/50 of tap water and DI water without any issue.
