In the Deathly Hallows, a Patronus crashes Bill and Fleur's wedding to deliver the message that "The Ministry has Fallen." Earlier, we knew that the death eaters had infiltrated the Ministry, and would try to use their control of it to shape the wizarding world into their own image.  
  
The changes include: a registry for witches/wizards who are muggle-born, a mandatory school-attendance policy to Hogwarts, and placing Death-Eaters in prominent positions of power such as appointing Severus Snape as the new Headmaster in Hogwarts. With deatheaters in Hogwarts, they can ensure that they can influence and control the minds of young witches/wizards.  
  
Ensuring "pureblood" status upon entry AND controlling curriculums is a stark callback to many times in history where the propaganda machines aims to start young. It's harder to convince and control people who can think critically.
