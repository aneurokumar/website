# Hi, I'm Anu. 
I'm a biotech professional based in Paris with 5+ years of lab experience across molecular biology, neurodevelopment, and mammalian cell culture. Currently, I'm working as Lab Operations Associate at Biolabs Hotel-Dieu, working at the intersection of biotech, sponsorship, operations, data, and community.

# About the Second Brain
Advancing through my career and projects, I noticed I was losing a lot of valuable knowledge. I had thousands of notes in various research notebooks, journals, and word documents detailing processes, terminology, and valuable experiences. With every new challenge, I lost time and motivation by reinventing wheels I <i>had already created.</i>

In Spring 2023, I read Building a Second Brain, then watched Nick Milo's video on Linking Your Thinking. Since then, I've been filling my Second Brain with notes and creating insights that I share with others.
